## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial classes in the html file to be later used for styling. Next I began styling the css by styling the div's that will display the information. I removed the hardcoded div's I used to be able to style so that I could add functionality via JavaScript. I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to display the key, keycode and code of the key pressed by the user.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned that the Keyboard Event property represents a physical key on the keyboard (as opposed to the character generated by pressing the key).

I also learned that window is the top level object in the browser. Adding an eventlistener to this object will "listen" on the entire window for the action.

### Continued development🔮

I also plan on continuing to practice using different event listeners to make my pages more functional.

I plan on practicing using more ternary's to strengthen my conditional statement skills.

I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occurred.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```js
window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  console.log(event);

  insert.innerHTML = `
  <div class="key">
  ${event.key === ' ' ? 'Space' : event.key}
        <small>event.key</small>
      </div>

      <div class="key">
        ${event.keyCode}
        <small>event.keyCode</small>
      </div>

      <div class="key">
        ${event.code}
        <small>event.code</small>
      </div>
  `;
});
```
